EMpower is a development platform that partners with local organizations to build physical and energy infrastructure in emerging markets. EMpower provides the highest standards of diligence, deal execution, and financing for infrastructure projects. In cooperation with its partners, EMpower identifies, develops, and markets infrastructure projects to sophisticated buyers in the US and Europe. This one-of-a-kind partnership model allows EMpower to most effectively leverage the local intelligence of targeted organizations while providing project finance expertise to advance the missions of its partners. This unique approach enables EMpower to quickly identify assets that are both critical to economic development and imminently financeable by American institutional standards. Targeted partners include established non-governmental organizations, leading institutions, and former government officials in financeable emerging markets.
